# To-Do List

Created a to-do list that utilizes HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
Type tasks and press enter to create a task.
Click tasks to delete.

interesting things I learned in this particular project:
- every keystroke has a certain keycode that you can use to watch for an event (in this case when the user presses enter)
- got exposed to methods: appendChild, createTextNode, createElement, getElementById.
